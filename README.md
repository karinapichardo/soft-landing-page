# soft-landing-page

This project was really fun to work on!

###I worked with:
* CSS grid
* Flex box
* AOS scroll animation library 
* Javascript

### I learned how to add cool / neat features, for example, background-attachments.
### I was also able to implement a navigation scroll bar that appears only once the user scrolls down a bit using javascript.

### I learned how javascript can make developing websites easier. In this project, I used event listeners instead of having to create multiple html pages.

Another big take away that I Iearned with this project, was the importance of developing websites that are cross platform. 

I learned how different browsers render information differently and itâ€™s crucial to be aware of those renderings. 

I look forward to learning more about the cool things that javascript can do. 
Also look forward to gaining more knowledge on building websites that are responsive across all platforms and visually beautiful at the same time.
